## Description

Developers Italia provides [a catalog of Free and Open Source](https://developers.italia.it/en/search)
software aimed to Public Administrations.

This **crawler** retrieves the `publiccode.yml` files from the
repositories of publishers found in the [Developers Italia API](https://github.com/italia/developers-italia-api).

## Setup and deployment processes

The crawler can either run manually on the target machine or it can be deployed
from a Docker container with
[its helm-chart](https://github.com/teamdigitale/devita-infra-kubernetes) in Kubernetes.

### Manually configure and build the crawler

1. Rename `config.toml.example` to `config.toml` and set the variables

   > **NOTE**: The application also supports environment variables in substitution
   > to config.toml file. Remember: "environment variables get higher priority than
   > the ones in configuration file"

2. Build the binary with `go build`

### Docker

The repository has a `Dockerfile`, used to build the production image,
and a `docker-compose.yml` file to setup the development environment.

1. Start the environment:

   ```shell
   docker-compose up
